# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
npx hardhat verify 0xBf3c7e598211F33b765F304521959173Bb77F6dA --network rinkeby
```
